**Predicting Market Boom and Bust Periods: A Multi-Year Analysis of Financial Metrics in Top Companies Across Major Industries**

#### Research Questions

- Do financial ratios, such as price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and debt-to-equity ratio, of top companies in the technology industry accurately predict market boom and bust periods?
- Which financial metrics of top companies in the energy industry, such as capital expenditures or return-on-equity, are the most reliable indicators of market trends?
- Can healthcare companies' financial performance, such as revenue growth and operating income, predict market trends with greater accuracy than those of other industries?

#### Hypotheses

- Technology industry companies with high P/E ratios will indicate a higher probability of market booms, while those with low P/E ratios will indicate a higher probability of market busts.
- The capital expenditures of energy industry companies will be a more accurate predictor of market trends than their return-on-equity.
- The financial performance of healthcare companies will be a better predictor of market trends than the financial performance of companies in other industries.
